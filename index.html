                    <h1>Larry Rosenberg: Long Path Home</h1>
                    <p>This inspiring 38-minute documentary portrait tells the unexpected story of teacher/author Larry
                        Rosenberg, one of the handful of people fundamentally responsible for having brought meditation
                        to widespread awareness and practice in American society.</p>

                    <p>With exquisite penetration and humor, Larry at 83 years of age describes his remarkable
                        long-term quest for self-discovery that eventually gave rise to the Cambridge Insight Meditation
                        Center, one of the nation’s most vibrant non-residential communities for meditation learning and
                        practice. In recent years his teaching and books have inspired devoted practitioners to
                        establish new meditation learning centers beyond Cambridge.</p>

                    <p>This intimate profile captures the warm-hearted dynamic personality that has made Larry such
                        a beloved instructor – while at the same time presenting the very core of his Buddhist
                        teachings. As we witness his skillful vipassana instruction in action, Larry reflects on the
                        more than
                        four decades he has been teaching the Buddha’s concepts about suffering and the end of
                        suffering,
                        helping countless people on their individual paths to self-discovery and liberation.</p>

                                personal and dharmic evolution converge and mature. You also see and feel why he is so
                                loved
                                by his students, and how his teachings have had such a profound impact in the world.

                                has played a significant role in introducing mindfulness meditation to the American
                                landscape as a vital element of daily life and as a rigorous formal practice.”
