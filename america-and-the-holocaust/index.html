                        90-minute historical documentary produced for PBS' <em>The American Experience</em>, exploring
                        America's
                        social and political response to the events leading up to and through the Holocaust.<br />

                        <br /><em>America and the Holocaust</em> paints a troubling picture of the United States during
                        a period
                        beset by anti-Semitism and a government that not only delayed action but suppressed information
                        and blocked efforts that could have resulted in the rescue of thousands of people. An
                        examination of these factors is framed by the moving story of Kurt Klein, a 17-year-old German
                        Jew who immigrated to America and struggled against a wall of domestic bureaucracy to free his
                        parents from Europe.
                        <br /><br />Winner of the Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Non-Current Events
                        Documentary of
                        1994, the film has also received a CINE Golden Eagle and a national Emmy nomination.
                    </p>

                    <p>Across the nation, America and the Holocaust has become a staple component in many secondary
                        schools' curricula on Holocaust education and the teaching of tolerance.</p>

                    <h2>Selected Reviews for<br>AMERICA AND THE HOLOCAUST: DECEIT AND INDIFFERENCE</h2>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“The American self-image of ethical uprightness in the face of Nazi terror during World
                            War II
                            has remained an unexamined myth of the national life. But the myth is broken, if not
                            shattered,
                            by Martin Ostrow's devastating 90-minute film for PBS' 'The American Experience,' ‘America
                            and
                            the Holocaust: Deceit and Indifference.’”</p>

                        <img src="../images/cid_clip_image003.jpg" alt="Kurt Klein's parents"
                            style="float: right; margin: 5px 0 15px 20px; max-width: 45%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px;">

                        <p>With a mass of paperwork and eyewitness testimony to back it up, Ostrow's work explains how
                            the U.S. government deliberately prevented the immigration of millions of Jews trying to
                            flee Nazi-occupied Europe. And the blame falls right into the lap of President Franklin D.
                            Roosevelt.</p>

                        <p>Yet Ostrow's superbly constructed history, lucidly narrated by Hal Linden and based largely
                            on scholar David S. Wyman's decades-long research, is not merely a critique of U.S. war-era
                            policy. It reveals an America shot through with deep anti-Semitic sentiments, and recounts
                            the tragic tale of Jewish refugee Kurt Klein's family. As Klein's running narrative is
                            intercut with the political scandal in the halls of Washington, 'America and the Holocaust'
                            sharply demonstrates how bureaucratic decisions carry personal and moral consequences.</p>

                        <p>Klein's story finally ends with a mixture of bittersweetness and tragedy that ranks with the
                            most moving chapters in Holocaust history.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“Since the end of World War II, evidence has accumulated that before and during the war the
                            State Department was in effect a pioneer in Holocaust revisionism. Tonight's troubling
                            documentary - 'America and the Holocaust: Deceit and Indifference' - adds the power of
                            pictures
                            and first-hand testimony to accusations that Washington played down the known facts of Nazi
                            persecution of Jews as a matter of policy and prejudice.</p>

                        <p>This 90-minute offering in 'The American Experience' series brings home the effects of the
                            official policy through the experience of Kurt Klein, who came to the United States in 1937
                            as a 17-year-old refugee from Germany, leaving his parents behind, temporarily, they hoped.
                            As the narrator recalls the growing threat to European Jewry, from Kristallnacht in November
                            1938 to the death camps of the 1940's, Mr. Klein tells how his parents' efforts to flee to
                            America were repeatedly blocked by State Department functionaries. The pictures of Jews
                            being rounded up and herded to camps, no less painful for their familiarity, make a grim
                            counterpoint to the fate of one family.</p>

                        <p>'America and the Holocaust' traces the Government's apparent indifference to the
                            anti-Semitism of the 1920's and 30's, with the German-American Bund, the Rev. Charles
                            Coughlin and nativist politicians leading the way. A former Treasury Department official
                            says State Department professionals also shrugged off the plight of the refugees in
                            deference to America's perceived economic and political interests in the Middle East. The
                            record may stir uncomfortable thoughts about current American behavior toward refugees from
                            despotism.</p>

                        <p>A particular villain of this account is Assistant Secretary of State Breckenridge Long, who
                            is blamed for exaggerating security concerns in order to keep refugees out. His technique is
                            revealed by a memorandum he wrote in 1940: 'We can delay and effectively stop for a
                            temporary period of indefinite length the number of immigrants into the United States. We
                            could do this by simply advising our consuls to put every obstacle in the way, which would
                            postpone and postpone and postpone the granting of the visas.’”</p>

                        <p>“Given the events in Kosovo, Martin Ostrow's 'America and the Holocaust: Deceit and
                            Indifference' seems particularly relevant these days, but of course this shameful story
                            of
                            American anti-Semitism and international indifference toward rescuing Europe's imperiled
                            Jews is
                            a tale that bears repeating regardless.</p>

                        <p>Fate of 6 million is told through the story of two, the stranded German Jewish parents of
                            teenage refugee Kurt Klein. By 1937, Kurt and his brother and sister are in America,
                            working
                            to get their parents here, too. But anti-Semitism, anti-immigrant sentiments, Middle
                            East
                            oil politics, State Department denials and purposeful bureaucratic delays foretell no
                            family
                            reunion.</p>

                        <p>Filmmaker Ostrow employs a deft hand with this unnerving subject. He shows how Allied
                            heavy
                            bombers attacked an I.G. Farben fuel factory five miles from Auschwitz but never
                            received
                            orders to bomb the death camp. (Grainy black-and-white footage shot from a bomber show
                            how
                            its ordnance literally flew over Auschwitz on its way to the Farben plant.)</p>

                        <p>This film makes very effective use of freeze frame. The bomber's view of the barracks
                            gives
                            viewers a rare glimpse of the camp from the sky, rather than the usual ground-based
                            photos.
                            Equally disturbing is the freeze frame of President Franklin Roosevelt's handwriting on
                            a
                            note, requesting his position on the much-debated 1939 congressional bill to rescue
                            20,000
                            German and Austrian Jewish children: 'File, no action. FDR.' Footage then cuts to 1940,
                            and
                            a ship of singing English children arriving here under government protection.</p>

                        <p>When Congress, the State Department and Roosevelt failed those 20,000 despite confirmed
                            reports that their co-religionists were being massacred, American Jews appealed directly
                            to
                            fellow citizens. The 1943 wartime pageant 'We Shall Never Die' featured actress Sylvia
                            Sydney proclaiming, 'Here the Germans turned machine guns on us and killed us all.
                            Remember
                            us.'</p>

                        <p>It was... a small but determined team of Treasury Department staffers who, in 1944,
                            pushed
                            Roosevelt into creating the War Refugee Board, which helped save about 200,000 Jews and
                            assisted Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg rescue thousands of Hungarian Jews.</p>

                        <p>The 90-minute documentary concludes with a too-little-too-late view of wartime America.
                            One
                            historian states that because America refused to rescue thousands of other Jews, the
                            country
                            could not rescue its own conscience.”</p>
